*Hi, Iâ€™m PutriðŸ‘‹*


Welcome to this small corner of the internet that I decided to call my digital garden ðŸª´.

Itâ€™s not a polished portfolio; itâ€™s more like a messy desk where I leave my learning progress. Think of it as a public workspace where I collect experiments, questions, and passing curiosities.

Iâ€™m not an amazing coder. I first picked up Jekyll while working in project management at DH, teaching myself just enough to get by. This garden grew out of thatâ€”my way of keeping what Iâ€™ve learned alive and giving myself a space to keep tinkering.

My interests weave together across education, user research, photography (film and digital), crochet (which feels a lot like coding to me), gaming, hiking, and a fascination with tools for thinking like Notion or Obsidian. This garden is where those threads come together, sometimes neatly, sometimes as knots worth untangling.

I believe learning is best when itâ€™s shared, so Iâ€™m keeping my notes openâ€”even the unfinished or messy ones. Some entries will evolve into something more solid, others may stay as sketches. Either way, theyâ€™re stepping stones in how I think, learn, and create.

Want to chat? I check email every so often and sometimes show up on social media. Otherwise, thanks for wandering around my little plot on the web. ðŸŒ±
