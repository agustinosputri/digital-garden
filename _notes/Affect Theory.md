Affect theory is an approach to culture, history, sociality, and power that focuses on nonlinguistic forces, or affects. Affects make us what we are, but they are neither under our “conscious” control nor even necessarily within our awareness—and they can only sometimes be captured in language. Affect theory helps us understand power by encouraging us to think of power as theater.
