I'm still learning about Crown Shyness. It's fascinating phenomenon among trees and happened in the [[Botany]] world. Here's what I read from Wiki.

# Crown shyness (Tree crowns pattern in the forest)

The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.[6] The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.[9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent evolution.[citation needed]

Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.[10] If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11] This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.[6][12] According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
