--- title: Why I Started a Digital Garden ---
```

I started this digital garden because I didn’t want what I learned to fade away.

In the crowded, loud, and fast-paced world of social media, sharing something reflective and not thinking about engagement often feels like a waste of time. The cycle of contents moves so quickly that it’s easy for ideas to feel disposable, no matter how much thought or care went into them.

That pace has never suited me. I’ve always been more drawn to slower, quieter ways of thinking—whether that’s through reading, crocheting, hiking, or taking photographs on film. These are activities where progress is gradual and meaning reveals itself over time.

So when I first stumbled into the idea of a “digital garden,” it resonated deeply. Plus i love gardening in real life too. 🪴

I came to term digital gardening when I scroll on Bluesky. It reminds me of how I always love learning but sharing things where I feel like I am not an expert seems daunting. But digital gardening are more forgiving. So I started to look back at how to do it, then I remembered I worked with Jekyll before.

While working in project management at DH, I started teaching myself Jekyll. I’m not a professional coder, but curiosity pushed me to explore, and slowly I began to understand how things fit together. I realized, though, that if I didn’t keep practicing, I’d lose what I had learned. This site became my way of tending those skills, keeping them alive, and giving them space to grow.

But the garden isn’t just about code. It’s about creating a different kind of relationship with the digital world. Unlike the fleeting, polished snapshots that dominate social media, a digital garden allows for ideas that are evolving, incomplete, or messy. Notes here can change, expand, or link to other ideas over time. They don’t need to be final to be worth sharing.

There’s also something liberating about building a space that doesn’t depend on algorithms. No likes, no feeds, no pressure to perform. Just a small plot of internet soil to tend in my own way, at my own pace.

For me, this garden is an experiment in curiosity and connection. It’s a place where I can weave together the different threads of my life—education, research, photography, crochet, coding, travel, and the simple act of noticing. Some notes will stay as fragments; others may grow into something more. That’s the point. Growth here doesn’t happen in a straight line, but in layers and connections.

Digital gardens won’t solve everything, and I don’t see them as a replacement for social media. But they offer an alternative—a slower, more intentional way to share and reflect. They remind me that we’re allowed to tinker, to experiment, and to create without needing permission from an algorithm.

This is why I started mine. To learn in public. To keep things alive. To cultivate a space where ideas can grow, however slowly, and to see what emerges when they do. 🌱
