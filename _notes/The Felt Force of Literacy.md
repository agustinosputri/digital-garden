# The Felt Force of Literacy  

While reading about [[learning sciences]] on Bluesky, I stumbled across Ty Hollett‚Äôs *The Felt Force Literacy* (Penn State, 2020), a commentary in *Reading Research Quarterly*. The piece is part of a special issue on affect theory‚Äîa field with roots in Spinoza‚Äôs philosophy of affect, revived in the mid-20th century by Silvan Tomkins‚Äô psychology of affect, and expanded in cultural theory by scholars such as Eve Sedgwick and Brian Massumi. Affect theory foregrounds how feelings, atmospheres, and embodied intensities shape human life‚Äînot as secondary to rational thought but as central forces in experience.  

In educational research, this perspective disrupts the dominance of cognitive frames in learning sciences. It shifts attention from learning as only information processing to learning as deeply atmospheric and embodied. Emotions, moods, and collective currents don‚Äôt just color learning; they constitute it.  

Hollett‚Äôs commentary brings together three articles in the special issue (Nichols & Coleman; Garcia, Guggenheim, Stamatis, & Dalton; Burnett & Merchant) through the concepts of atmosphere and mobile architecture. Literacy practices, he argues, are not static but move through shifting environments‚Äîdigital, physical, emotional‚Äîshaped by the ‚Äúfelt force‚Äù of the moment. He names the affective landscape of 2020: masks-ventilators-fear-abundance of caution-distance-anxiety-Zoom school-Ahmaud-George-Breonna-fire-rage-murder-police.  

Reading this as a Muslim, first-generation immigrant currently teaching adult learners to read and write in English (both L1 and L2), I couldn‚Äôt help but pause and think about how I would rewrite the list for my own classroom and community. The words may differ, but the feeling is the same thread. For my students, the atmosphere is similarly charged, though experienced differently: many only access learning through their phones, negotiating both literacy and information on fragile infrastructures.  

This is why Hollett‚Äôs ‚Äúfelt force‚Äù struck me‚Äîit remains relevant across time and space. Despite the different political and cultural contexts, the central concern is the same: how does one describe the felt force of right now?  

For future inquiry, I am drawn to the notion of affective atmosphere in mobile architectures. I want to explore how affect circulates not just between humans but also through texts and technologies, particularly in contexts where learners rely on machine translation as a mediator. In my classroom, I notice how readers become dependent on translation apps‚Äînot as temporary scaffolds but as sources of truth. This dynamic opens questions about the distribution of power, the limits of literacy, and the affective weight of depending on a machine to render one‚Äôs voice legible.  

In other words, the ‚Äúfelt force‚Äù of literacy today might also include: the glow of a phone screen, the pause before hitting ‚Äútranslate,‚Äù the frustration of mistranslation, the relief of recognition.
