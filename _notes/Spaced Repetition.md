title: Spaced Repetition
---

When we learn something new, weâ€™re tapping into our working memory. You can think of it like a small, kind of flimsy blackboard that only holds about four [[Chunks|Chunk]] at a time. To get those chunks into long-term memory, we need [[Deliberate Practice|Deliberate Practice]] and the [[Recall|Recall]]  method. Spaced repetition just means spreading practice out over a few days so our brain builds stronger connections.

Basically, the more we learn and relearn, the better it sticks in our long-term memory.
