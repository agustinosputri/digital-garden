## What is a Chunk?
- A compact piece of information my brain can quickly access  
- A network of neurons that fire together, making thoughts or actions smoother  
- Pieces of information linked by use and meaning  

## What is Chunking?
- A mental shortcut that connects information through meaning  
- Forms a new logical whole that’s easier to remember  
- Helps fit details into the bigger picture of what we’re learning  
- Involves learning and applying problem-solving techniques  

## How to Form Chunks
- Give **focused attention**  
- Build **basic understanding** as the foundation  
- Use "super glue" strategies to strengthen memory traces  
- Apply [Delibrate Practice] to gain mastery and context  
- Form conceptual chunks that tie scattered info together  
- Add small chunks onto larger ones  
- Remember: chunking is a **bottom-up process** → practice and [Spaced Repetition] strengthen chunks  
- Use **context (top-down process)** to see where new learning fits in  
- Both **top-down (big picture)** and **bottom-up (chunking)** are key to [Gain Mastery]  
- Practice growing chunks to build a **library of chunk patterns**  
- Use diffuse mode thinking to connect multiple chunks  

> **Note:** Stress and emotions like anger or fear can weaken your ability to form and connect chunks.
