# Pattern Recognition
Pattern recognition is about identifying attributes that occur in repetition, with and without variable intervals.

### Pattern recognition in language acquisition
Research from Frost et al., 2013 reveals that infant language acquisition is linked to cognitive pattern recognition.[22] Unlike classical nativist and behavioral theories of language development,[23] scientists now believe that language is a learned skill.[22] Studies at the Hebrew University and the University of Sydney both show a strong correlation between the ability to identify visual patterns and to learn a new language.[22][24] Children with high shape recognition showed better grammar knowledge, even when controlling for the effects of intelligence and memory capacity.[24] This is supported by the theory that language learning is based on statistical learning,[22] the process by which infants perceive common combinations of sounds and words in language and use them to inform future speech production.

### Phonological development
The first step in infant language acquisition is to decipher between the most basic sound units of their native language. This includes every consonant, every short and long vowel sound, and any additional letter combinations like "th" and "ph" in English. These units, called phonemes, are detected through exposure and pattern recognition. Infants use their "innate feature detector" capabilities to distinguish between the sounds of words.[23] They split them into phonemes through a mechanism of categorical perception. Then they extract statistical information by recognizing which combinations of sounds are most likely to occur together,[23] like "qu" or "h" plus a vowel. In this way, their ability to learn words is based directly on the accuracy of their earlier phonetic patterning.


### Grammar development
The transition from phonemic differentiation into higher-order word production[23] is only the first step in the hierarchical acquisition of language. Pattern recognition is furthermore utilized in the detection of prosody cues, the stress and intonation patterns among words.[23] Then it is applied to sentence structure and the understanding of typical clause boundaries.[23] This entire process is reflected in reading as well. First, a child recognizes patterns of individual letters, then words, then groups of words together, then paragraphs, and finally entire chapters in books.[25] Learning to read and learning to speak a language are based on the "stepwise refinement of patterns"[25] in perceptual pattern recognition.
